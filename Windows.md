# Windows

The easiest way to run the code on Windows is to install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/).

When you install it, be sure to install `Desktop development with C++` and select all optional features.

## Installation

If you did not install the `Desktop development with C++`, open Visual Studio and select `Continue without code →`.

![open](img/open.png)

This will open Visual Studio. Select the `Tools` menu and open `Get Tools and Features...`.

This will open a menu similar to that when you first install it. Select `Desktop development with C++` (and select all optional features). Then confirm by pressing `Modify`.

This will take a while (depending on your network).

## Running the code

When you open Visual Studio, select `Create a new project`.

![project](img/project.png)

This will open a new window where you select which project. If everything is installed correctly, you should have `Console App` in the menu and click next. If not, check [Installation](installation).

The next window lets you choose the path and project name. Choose something that makes sense to you and press `create`.

Finally, you should have a `C++` file open in the middle with some sample code.

To **save, compile, and run** the code, press the play button.

After compilation, a terminal should pop up with the program's output. The terminal also contains other stuff — look at the first line!

To run any other code, simply copy-paste the code over the cpp file.
